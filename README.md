# Overview

For this software learning session, I was attempting to learn how to use pygame with sounds and graphics.

I was attempting to write a game that would be a jet shooting aliens that randomly showed up on the screen.

I wanted to learn how to use pygame.

# Future Work

* I really wanted to make this work but I think I made it too complicated. I was trying to take a space invader game and switch it to be left to right instead of top to bottom.
* Add in more elements that work.
* Learn more about pygame and creating games with coding.
